**Task 1 / 5**  
Sarah created a new file named `notes-t1q9.txt` under `/home/sarah/story-blog-t1q9` repository where she plans to write down ideas about the story for personal purposes. She does not want git to track this file or share it with her team mates.

It is good that the file is untracked. But it is still under GIT's radar. If you run the git add . command, accidentally git will start to track this file.

Let's configure git to ignore this file permanently.

Solution:
```
cd /home/sarah/story-blog-t1q9
echo "notes-t1q9.txt" > .gitignore
git add .
git commit -m "Created a .gitignore file and appended 'notes-t1q9.txt' for Git to ignore the text file"
```

Solution:
```
mkdir -p /home/sarah/story-blog-t1q4 && cd $_
